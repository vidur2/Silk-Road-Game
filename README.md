# Description
This is a game loosely based of the mechanics of Oregon Trail. It is based on the silk road. Since spices were traded along that route, we decided to call our game the 'Oregano Road.' Currently, this game is just a terminal game, however, later we may expand to usinga gui via python's turtle package.
